# Themes Icons #

We want the app icon of themes for BIG! caller ID to be coherent among all themes and developers. If you use Adobe Photoshop, you can use the attached template to quickly create app icon for Google Play page, theme.apk file and thumbnail for BIG! caller ID.

When you open the PSD file, double-click on thumbnails of layers with [EDIT](EDIT.md) description (2 embedded files). Drop a screenshot into the last file, save the two opened files, and save the .png file in three sizes:
• 512x512px for Google Play (original size),
• 96x96, 72x72, 48x48px for app icons in different screen densities,
• 75x75px for Themes submenu in BIG! caller ID (remove "THEME ribbon" layer here)
